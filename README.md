The app uses:
* Angular 8 with CLI (Ivy broken due to @angular/flex-layout)
* NodeJS with data saved in .json
* Angular Material
* RxJS
* Responsive design - on mobile table view changes to column
* British car plate validation in format: AA11AAA
* loading spinner for all backend actions

* make sure you have Node >= 10
